        <h1>1. What is Bootstrap?</h1>
        <p>Bootstrap is a giant collection of handy, reusable bits of code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s also a frontend development framework that enables developers and designers to quickly build fully responsive websites.</p>
      <h1>2. Is it necessary to use Bootstrap in your web projects? </h1>
      <p>Yes, because bootstrap has served a very useful purpose of helping developers and designers alike come to terms with the concept of mobile-friendly design. Bootstrap has had a huge role to play in the adoption of responsive web design as a standard on the web. With its fluid grid system and several other features, Bootstrap has made it easy for every designer out there to have a frontend design that works perfectly fine across multiple mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, and also scales well for the desktop resolutions. </p>
      <h1>3. Give examples of some websites that currently use or used Bootstrap in the past.</h1>

    <p>Twitter is one of the most popular social networking sites. It combines blogging, texting, and social media. Tweets are short messages that people use to communicate, and anyone who follows you can like, retweet, and comment on your tweets.
